# Development Guide for AI

## Dev environment tips
- Our RBS types in `sig/` are generated by rbs-inline and our scripts in `script/`.
  - To update them, run `rake rbs`.

## Testing instructions

- In this repository, we use the following tools:
  - RSpec (for testing)
  - RuboCop (for linting)
  - Steep (for type checking)
- To run these all tools, use `bundle exec rake`.
- When you add or modify code, please follow TDD workflow.
- Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.

## PR instructions

- Always run `rake autocorrect` before committing.
